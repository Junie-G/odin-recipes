    <h2>Grannie's southern style breaded shrimp!</h2>
    <p>This recipe was passed down from my grandmother and has been in the family for 25 years!</p>
    <p>Now, I can share the recipe for the shrimp but the sauce will have to remain a secret...</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>4 cups shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 cups dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350F</li>
            <li>Working one at a time, dip shrimp into beaten egg, allowing any excess egg to drip back inot the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place breaded shrimp, unstacked, onto plate. Repeat with remaining shrimp.</li>
            <li>Lower breaded shrimp carefully into preheated oil in batches. Fry until crispy and golden brown, about 4-5 minutes. Transfer to paper-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining breaded shrimp.</li>
