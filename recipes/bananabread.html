    <h2>Grannie's family famous banana bread!</h2>
    <p>Nearly everyone loves the taste of banana bread! I almost always have a loaf of fresh, moist banana bread sitting on the dining room table for the family to snack on between meals, and I think itâ€™s a good habit others should adopt too.
    </p>
    <p> The best bananas for banana bread are the ones that are already black, or at least dark brown. To keep banana bread moist in storage, be sure to keep it in an airtight container like plastic wrap or Tupperware! You can also freeze banana bread for four months and it will stay good.</p>
